A question-answering system that utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model and a sentence embedding model to provide answers based on a set of predefined documents. It begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up logging for tracking information and errors. A list of custom documents is defined, and embeddings for these documents are created to represent their meanings numerically. The system includes a function to retrieve the most relevant documents for a given query using cosine similarity and another function that generates answers by leveraging the RAG model and the retrieved documents. Error handling is incorporated to manage potential issues during answer generation, and a batch processing function allows multiple questions to be answered simultaneously. Finally, the code executes this batch processing on a set of example questions and prints the corresponding answers.
